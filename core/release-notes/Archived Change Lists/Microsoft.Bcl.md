### 1.1.0-beta

### 1.0.19

* Marked as stable

### 1.0.16-rc

* Fixed: Adding empty content to .NET 4.5, Windows Phone 8, Windows 8 and
  portable combinations, so that `app.config` transforms are not applied to
  projects targeting them
* Fixed: `System.Runtime` is missing a type forward for `Tuple<T1, T2>`
* Fixed: `System.Runtime` now has a fixed version for Phone 7.x due to the lack
  of a way to redirect them to a later version.
* Fixed: First-chance exceptions when running on Phone 7.x
* Fixed: `Microsoft.Bcl.targets` are not imported when using NuGet 2.0 to
  install `Microsoft.Bcl`
* Changed: Pulled build targets into a separate package (`Microsoft.Bcl.Build`)
  so other BCL packages can depend on it.

* [Announcement](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/bclteam/archive/2012/10/22/using-async-await-without-net-framework-4-5.aspx)
